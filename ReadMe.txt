# Ticket-System

## The following program is built using an old JDK version 14.0.2 running SE-14 thus allowing any JDK above this to work.
Originally was built with JDK 19.0.2 and although not using any new features would not load with previous versions hence have backdated for compatabilty.
Any issue with the code running on start or errors could be resultant of JDK issue please ensure for perfect working the JRE System Library is set to SE-14.
