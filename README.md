# Ticket-System
# Assignment 2 for Software Engineering Project Management
Develop a ReadMe.txt file to explain how your code should be executed, and submit this file with all three of your
submissions. Update the file as necessary for the second and third submission to
incorporate new elements of your code. Write the instructions for a user who will be using
RMIT’s myDesktop (https://mydesktop.rmit.edu.au/) to run your code. You should test these
instructions to make sure they work – have a member of your team follow your own
instructions using RMIT’s myDesktop facility, step by step!




To use the ticketing-system program you will have to open up an IDE that is capable of running JAVA. 
To do this browse to https://mydesktop.rmit.edu.au/ and login using your RMIT student details. 
After you have logged in, go to the Apps tab located on the left hand side pane. From there you should 
see a lot of applications available to you to use. Search and select on the Eclipse application, there could be 
multiple so for this just select the one without a date in its name. 
To run a java program through Eclipse follow these steps 

1. Open Eclipse and create a new project by selecting "File" > "New" > "Java Project".

2. Name the project and select a default JRE version.

3. Right-click on the project in the Package Explorer and select "Import".

4. Select "File System" and browse to the location of the Java program you want to run.

5. Select the Java file and click "Finish" to import it into your project.

6. Once the file is imported, right-click on it in the Package Explorer and select "Run As" > "Java Application".

7. If the program requires any command-line arguments, you can specify them in the "Run Configurations" dialog.

8. Click "Run" to execute the program.

Alternatively, you can also create a new "Run Configuration" by selecting "Run" > "Run Configurations" and then selecting "Java Application". From there, you can specify the project and main class to run.
