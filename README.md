# Assignment 2 for Software Engineering Project Management
Develop a ReadMe.txt file to explain how your code should be executed, and submit this file with all three of your
submissions. Update the file as necessary for the second and third submission to
incorporate new elements of your code. Write the instructions for a user who will be using
RMIT’s myDesktop (https://mydesktop.rmit.edu.au/) to run your code. You should test these
instructions to make sure they work – have a member of your team follow your own
instructions using RMIT’s myDesktop facility, step by step!
