incorporate new elements of your code. Write the instructions for a user who will be using
RMIT’s myDesktop (https://mydesktop.rmit.edu.au/) to run your code. You should test these
instructions to make sure they work – have a member of your team follow your own
instructions using RMIT’s myDesktop facility, step by step!
